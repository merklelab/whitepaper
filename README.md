### Abstract

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been around for close to a decade. As of yet, we have not gone beyond the early adopters \(&lt;1%\) and taken off in masses. There are several challenges for the same. We believe this is not just a technological scale challenge, but also a product and community challenge. This is what Opoch aims to solve.

For billions of users, Opoch is the mobile app that unveils the true Information age. It begins by connecting these users with peers for exchanging fiat currencies with crypto assets without any 3rd party intermediary. But, it really propels the crypto ecosystem with its built-in decentralised exchange and open platform empowering developers and businesses to innovate freely.

Opoch is powered by our open-source multi-currency cross-platform wallet with social recovery of private keys, helping everyone hold their digital assets securely with themselves. All private keys are stored offline and only signed transactions are shared as required by Opoch and other applications on top of it.

Opoch brings Cryptocurrencies to the masses.
