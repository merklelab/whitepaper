# Token \(OPOC\)

The Opoch Token, or OPOC, is the native token of the Opoch. Participation requires a user to possess OPOCs. Those that do not are incentivised to earn OPOCs by engaging in activities that contribute to the health of the ecosystem. As with all ERC20 tokens, OPOCs will be tradable following the crowd sale \(details in annexure\).

The OPOC has been envisioned for a three-fold objective: to lubricate process and drive utility on the protocol; to incentivise participation; to empower governance.

### Utility Toll

To quote Ethereum Foundation advisor William Mougayar, 

> ...there needs to be a specific linkage between user actions and the resulting effects of those actions on the overall value to the organization.

OPOC enables utility and lubricates process on the protocol. **OPOC tokens** allow us to appreciate and reward the early pioneers for their endeavours in driving adoption.
