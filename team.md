Building awesome stuff requires focus on the product rather than the name below it. The close bond, zero tolerance for bullshit, and experience with successes and failures, uniquely positions the team to take on the challenges for Opoch Age. The information revolution will not be overnight, but require decades of perspiration and hard work. The team knows its strengths and weaknesses, has mastered internal communication and is committed to growth and discipline that the opportunity demands.
